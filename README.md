# NoChineseManIsEverWorkingAt-n-o-m-i-a-l-UnlessIfTheyreIncrediblyIncrediblyQualified-CannotBeTrusted

they are incredibly insecure and dangerous when they are around intelligent women/ppl, telling u this from multiple experiences ive had, and then they start stealing my work & become obsessed with me. happened to my brother as well. never again, never never never

my brother said he has an immigrant chinese man in his team that knows nothing about ai/ml, and he explains things to him, tells him what to do. and in meetings with everyone, that immigrant chinese man presents everything as his own work even when its not

they get hired bc they seem to be apolitical, nonproblematic but theyre incredibly political, they play some of the most dangerous political games at work and ive known this since rutgers

never ever ever, all those immigrant chinese man CVs are going in the trash @ n o m i a l
